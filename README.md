# DevIt
A forum website.

My first **big** project with php.
It was made as a practice for a hackathon
Uses mysql as its data base.

It's kinda badly organized.

Devit is a simple and minimalistic forum website dedicated for programmers in general, 
it's like reddit but focused a lot more on programming related topics.

## Features

- User authentication  
- Create a topic (create a subreddit)  
- Create a post on a topic  
- Multiple UI themes  
- Like posts  
- Change your user description  
- Browse topics (subreddits)
- Minimalistic and intuitive UI
- Notifications (for when post is liked)

## Languages
 - php
 - js
 - css (not tailwind css)
 - html (not even a real programming lang)
 - SQL (for interacting with mysql db)

Currently it's code needs a lot of refactoring.
